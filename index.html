                <h2> New York</h2>
                <P>
                  New York, often called New York City (NYC) to distinguish it from the state of New York, 
                  is the most populous city in the United States. With a 2020 population of 8,804,190 
                  distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), New York City is also the most densely
                   populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of 
                   New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest 
                   metropolitan area in the world by urban area. With over 20.1 million people in its 
                   metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 
                   2020, New York is one of the world's most populous megacities. New York City has been 
                   described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly 
                   influencing commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism,
                   dining, art, fashion, and sports, and is the most photographed city in the world.
                   Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for 
                   international diplomacy, and has sometimes been called the capital of the world.
              
                  Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is composed of five 
                  boroughs, each of which is coextensive with a respective county of the state of New York.
                  The five boroughs—Brooklyn (Kings County), Queens (Queens County), Manhattan (New York
                  County), the Bronx (Bronx County), and Staten Island (Richmond County)—were created when 
                  local governments were consolidated into a single municipal entity in 1898.[13] The city 
                  and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the
                  United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most 
                  linguistically diverse city in the world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million 
                  residents born outside the United States, the largest foreign-born population of any 
                  city in the world as of 2016. As of 2018, the New York metropolitan area is 
                  estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of nearly $1.8 trillion, 
                  ranking it first in the United States. If the New York metropolitan area were a 
                  sovereign state, it would have the eighth-largest economy in the world. New York is 
                  home to the second highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.

            <h2>Lady Liberty</h2>
            <p>The concept of liberty has frequently been represented by personifications, often loosely shown as a female classical goddess. Examples include Marianne, the national personification of the French Republic and its values of Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, the female Liberty portrayed on United States coins for well over a century, and many others. These descend from images on ancient Roman coins of the Roman goddess Libertas and from various developments from the Renaissance onwards. The Dutch Maiden was among the first, re-introducing the cap of liberty on a liberty pole featured in many types of image, though not using the Phrygian cap style that became conventional. The 1886 Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World) by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi is a well-known example in art, a gift from France to the United States.The ancient Roman goddess Libertas was honored during the second Punic War (218 to 201 BC) by a temple erected on the Aventine Hill in Rome by the father of Tiberius Gracchus. In a highly political gesture, a temple for her was raised in 58 BC by Publius Clodius Pulcher on the site of Marcus Tullius Cicero's house after it had been razed. When depicted as a standing figure, on the reverse of coins, she usually holds out, but never wears, a pileus, the soft cap that symbolised the granting of freedom to former slaves. She also carries a rod, which formed part of the ceremony for manumission. In the 18th century, due to antiquarians misunderstanding the shape, the pileus turned into the similar Phrygian cap carried on a pole by English-speaking "Liberty" figures, and then worn by Marianne and other 19th-century personifications, as the "cap of liberty".</p>
